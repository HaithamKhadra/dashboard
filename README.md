# Social media dashboard with theme switcher

## Introduction

This is a [FrontendMentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-media-dashboard-with-theme-switcher-6oY8ozp_H). The main purpose of this challenge is to build a color theme toggler, in addition to building a responsive but static social media dashboard.

The main focus of this challenge was mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JavaScript included for the  color theme toggle.


The visitors of this Landing page are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

- Toggle color theme to their preference (Dark/Light mode).


## Lessons Learned

- After watching a couple of youtube tutorials, I started to form a general idea about how to go about implementing the color theme switcher, so I decided a common best practice where I defined css custom properties on the :root pseudo-class, and added a darkmode class having the same css variables name but set to darker colors, and whem the checkbox input is checked with the help of couple of line of JavaScript the darkmode class is added to the body tag and it will eventually overides the :root pseudo-class colors.
